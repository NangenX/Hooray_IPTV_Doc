In the `VOD Category` feature, administrators can create, modify, and delete categories for movies. By creating VOD categories, administrators can better organize and associate the corresponding movies with the respective categories. This allows subscribers to conveniently search and categorize the movies they want to watch.

Administrators can create new `VOD category` by clicking on the `Add` button.
